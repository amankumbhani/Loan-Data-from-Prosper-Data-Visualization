## Installation
<a id='installation'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python except for Seaborn.

You can install seaborn using the command below;
```
conda install -c anaconda seaborn
```

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
<a id='projectmotivation'></a>
For this project, I was interested in using Loan Data from Prosper to find out;
1. The loan status for borrowers
2. The most common income range
3. The most common prosper ratings
4. The states which have the highest borrowers & their monthly income
5. Does income range impact loan amount?
6. Does employment status impact loan amount?
7. Relationship between applicants income range & whether they own a home
8. Comparing borrower rate with income range for home owners
9. Comparing loan amount with employment status for home owners
10. Loan amounts across income range & term of loan

## File Descriptions
<a id='filedescriptions'></a>
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
There is another notebook named Slide Deck.ipynb which is a presentation on the findings based on the analysis & is created using Jupyter Notebooks.
1. prosperLoanData.csv - Contains the Loan details for all borrowers.
